## Context
A national sandwich shop wants to enable 'fax in your order' but over the Internet instead (in addition to their current fax-in service)

- Users: thousands, perhaps one day millions
- Requirements:
    - users will place their order, then be given a time to pick up their sandwich and directions to the shop (which must integrate with several external mapping services that include traffic information)
    - if the shop offers a delivery service, dispatch the driver with the sandwich to the user
    - mobile-device accessibility
    - offer national daily promotionals/specials
    - offer local daily promotionals/specials
    - accept payment online or in person/on delivery
- Additional Context:
    - Sandwich shops are franchised, each with a different owner.
    - Parent company has near-future plans to expand overseas.
    - Corporate goal is to hire inexpensive labor to maximize profit.
