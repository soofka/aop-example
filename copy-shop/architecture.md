Last updated: 03-06-2024


## Context
A local copy shop chain wants to offer its customers an 'all-in-one' computing experience: document creation, editing, storage, and printing.

- Users: initially, thousands in the local city, but potentially millions if the demand grows
- Requirements:
  - browser-based or delivered documents
  - word processing
  - presentations
  - document templates (as start points)
  - versioning
  - print scheduling
  - automatic and manual payment for storage, printing, etc.
- Additional Context:
  - main reason for this initiative is better customer engagement and loyalty
  - for historical reasons, operations is handled by another company and isn't very responsive
